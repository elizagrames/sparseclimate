# Sparse modeling for climate variable selection

This repo contains scripts and data for running a Bayesian sparse model for climate variable selection. The curated/cleaned data files with one population metric per yaer are derived from publicly accessible data; DOIs for the original data are contained in the script. Please contact egrames@unr.edu with questions or to request a pre-print of the associated manuscript.
